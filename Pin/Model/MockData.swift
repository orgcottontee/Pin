As a native of Tokyo, Japan, I not only have grown up eating rice, but also have developed a palate to appreciate the best quality Japanese and international cuisines thanks to my parents. When I first tasted the rice made by this double-lid donabe rice cooker, Kamado-san from Iga, Japan back in 2007, I was blown away! It was no doubt the best quality rice I had ever tasted and didnâ€™t even need any condiments because it was just so delicious as itself. The rice made in Kamado-san was so shiny and fluffy, and it was so easy to prepare. It tasted better than any rice cooked with any kinds of rice cooking tools I had ever tried. So, I contacted Nagatani-en, our relationship was established immediately, and I started importing only a few pieces of Kamado-san at a time in 2008. I built the website myself just to sell this one product, and sold out of my house in LA."
